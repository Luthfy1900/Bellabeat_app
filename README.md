## This is a project based on trying to find how consumers use the fitness app for the marketing team so as to know what products to create or market effectively. I did a lot of data exploration, cleaning and manipulation to try and find trends.
## I used a combination of SQL, Excel and Tableau to showcase the insights i found. For the Excel documents, they are already in the document and for my Tableau portion here is the link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/luthfy.es.haq#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0
